This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## The task

I am preparing for a language test, and one of the exercise is a chunk of text with missing word (prepositions and suchlike). I wanted to prepare for it by automatically preparing some from newpaper articles, and so on.

## The stack

- React (CRA) for the FE, straight out of the box, no addons
- Python for scraping
- Hapi for the REST API
