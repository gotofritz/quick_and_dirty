 I managed to watch these with the kids just before I tested positive. If there
is one 80s classic one has cannot miss this is it. Because of its influence on
every time travel plot that came after. I was expecting the worst, but Zemeckis
&amp; Co. surprised me. Cheesy, of course, but they handle the time travel paradoxes
well. Better than The Flash, which came out 4 decades later. The over acting is
irritating, particularly Fox, but the dystopian scenarios quite good. The kids
loved it too.

 I am sure I am not the first to notice that Biff's dystopian world == Trump's
America, right? And I can only image what the woke brigade would have made of
the movie had it came out today. With McFly inventing rock'n'roll, and teaching
it to a black man. I quite liked how thy alluded to the whole Civil Rights
movement without needing to get into it. The car from the future running on
recycled rubbish was also a good touch.

 Cooked: focaccia

 I used to make my own focaccia every week when I lived in London. I had my own
sourdough starter and everything. But I stopped when I moved to Germany. No need
to, the bread here is excellent. In England they sell this super-light spongy
material which they call "sliced bread". It has the same nutritional value as
shoelaces, but none of their tastiness.

 Just before covid hit us I had bought a cube of fresh yeast on a whim. The
perfect activity to keep us entertained in those quarantine days! Actually,
focaccia is quick to make, the entertainment didn't last that long. The baking
tray I used was too small; it rose quite a lot in the middle, and the end result
was underwhelming. Next time.

 Wife craved Asian noodle soup in the early, fluey stages of her covid. I had
bookmarked a vegan pho recipe on Bon Appetit only a day earlier. I do very
little vegan stock these days. Making a tasty stock without meat is an art which
requires effort. More effort than I am prepared to put in for the little amounts
I use. Freezing doesn't help, defrosted veg stock is just dirty water. But it
was for a good cause, so I cooked the pho. To my surprise, not only was it super
easy, barely an inconvenience, but very tasty indeed. Will do again.

 HBO wasn't a thing in the UK when The Wire was out, so we never got into it.
Luckily I had just been to the library the Saturday before the infection struck.
I had gotten the whole first series out on DVD. The perfect entertainment for
the quarantine! I have no deep insights on the series, it's brilliant, we are
loving it it. I'll hunt down all the other series when I get out.

 The youth reprimanded me for a "Happy International Women's Day" on a social
media platform. I'd be on board if the motivation is that it's only paying lip
service. Or that there is a long way to go. But the problem is that Women's Day
is cringe, and it's something that only boomers talk about. Oh well. Good job
that I don't give a flying fuck what they youth say.
